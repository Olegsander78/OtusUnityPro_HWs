    localizedTitle: Chicken Thieves
    storyScenarioQuestStage: Adventurer, welcome! You are on time. The village needs
      your help again. Someone at night got into the habit of stealing our unfortunate
      hens. Traces of thieves lead to the old lair. These are rat tracks and they
      are huge.
    storyScenarioQuestStageOnCompleted: Great, you kicked out those rat thieves.
      The villagers and especially the chickens are very grateful for your help.
